**JavaScript** is currently one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. It is growing faster than any other language, with major companies like Netflix, Walmart, and PayPal.

> You can work as a front-end, back-end, or full-stack developer.

## What It Does

You can develop dynamic and interactive web applications, build server-side applications using frameworks like _Node.js_, create mobile apps, design games, and even develop desktop applications.

## Background

It was initially designed to run solely in web browsers, which is why each browser includes a JavaScript engine capable of executing JavaScript code.

For instance, Firefox uses the SpiderMonkey _JavaScript engine_, while Chrome uses _V8_. In _2009_, **Ryan Dahl**, an innovative engineer, embedded Chrome’s open-source JavaScript engine into a **C++** program, creating what is now known as Node.

In summary, JavaScript code can be executed either in a browser or in Node, both of which provide _a runtime environment_ for running JavaScript code.

## NodeJS

**Node** is `C++` program that includes Google's V8 JavaScript engine. Now with this, we can run JavaScript code outside of the browser. We can pass our our JavaScript code to Node for execution, and this means, with JavaScript, we can build the _backend_ for our web and mobile applications.

## ECMAScript

**ECMAScript** is a `specification` that JavaScript adheres to, defined by the standards organization ECMA. The first version was released in 1997, and since _2015_, they have been issuing annual updates with the newest specification, known as `ES2015` or `ES6`. This specification introduced numerous new features to JavaScript.

## JavaScript In Use

Each browser comes with a built-in _JavaScript engine_, allowing us to write and execute JavaScript code directly without needing any extra tools. This isn’t the approach used for building production application. It’s simply convenient for quick demonstrations.

Open Chrome, right-click on an empty space, and select **“Inspect”**. This will open the Developer Tools. Navigate to the **Console** tab, where you can write and execute any valid JavaScript code examples.

Enter the following:

![js-log-hello](images/js-log-hello.png)

> The left-pointing arrow in the console shows the return value of the expression. If a function doesn’t return a value, it will return `undefined`.

You can also enter mathematical expressions here:

```
> 3 + 4
◀ 7
```

You can also use methods like:

```
> alert('hey') (Displays a popup dialog with the message)
```
